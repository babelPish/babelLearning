Mervis (Mervis 1984, 1987a) and others (e.g., Anglin 1977) have taken this as evidence that children acquire basic category representations first in development.\n",

L. showed preserva- tion of the basic-level names ‘‘dog,’’ ‘‘cat,’’ and ‘‘horse’’ after he had lost such names for other animals, and indeed overextended these labels to other, similar animals, naming many large animals ‘‘horse,’’ medium-sized animals ‘‘dog,’’ and small animals ‘‘cat’’ (Hodges, Graham, and Patterson 1995).\n",

In the biological taxonomy, dogs are more similar to wolves than to cats; however, there are many properties shared by cats and dogs but not by wolves, which are captured by the con- cept pet—for example, they are tame, friendly, companionable, and so on.
